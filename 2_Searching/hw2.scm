; Rationale for list-length for max-depth: This is under the rationale that. in the worst case solution and given
; that there is a solution, you can ALWAYS solve the problem in n swaps (n being length). It is under the same rationale 
; as selection sort. It takes 1 swap to put a state into its correct state. With the max depth being length, I believe
; dfs should be able to encapsulate this scenario. Hopefully I'm right :)... Fingers crossed. This is my own thoughts.
; no math to prove it. sorry. 

; OTHERWISE....
; My Initial Thoughts: Initially I thought it may have needed to be the permutation for max depth since this 
; would cover every literal combination possible. AND it would still work! I just think the length... may be 
; a the best minimum value to cover everything... (hopefully I'm right)

; EDIT: 
; Turns out you only need length -1 (as specified from email from professor)
; Doesn't hurt to leave it at n. theoretically it will still find a solution there. 

; TO BE OPTIMAL (Minimal Amount of Swaps):
; I would start from list-length, if I find a result. Increment down until you get your first #f. Last success (minimal depth needed)
; will be the optimal in terms of swap.. but seems very costly. I guess thats why we need heuristics (to not exhaustively search)


; This will start id-dfs to start with a max depth of 1 ... n where n is list of length
; It will return when it finds the first possible solution
; If it iteratives through 1 .. n without finding a success state. It will return false

; ---------------------------- A* Functions -------------------------------
; Definition of Heuristic - How close you are to a solution

; My Heuristic - How "Sorted" are you? (I know... very Naive and simple .. with faults.. which I'll get to)

; Given a list (A B C D), you earn 1 point for every neighbor you are actually adjacent to (via adjacency map)
; here if (A B C D) is the goal state, it gets 6 points (since everybody was adjacent to each other)
;       +  1 2 2 1    = 6 
; Lets say B was ONLY adjacent to C   (also meaning A is not adjacent to B )
;        (A B C D)
;       + 0 1 2 1     = 4

; Analyzing this heuristic I can already see its faults:
;     - Doesn't work well if it requires "shifting"  
;           i.e.    if (A B C D was the only goal state) (B C D A) will produce a high heuristic, but still cost a large
;                   number of swaps to get it to the goal state still
;     (meaning, if there are partial correctly "sorted" portions of the state. it will product a false-positive high heuristic)
